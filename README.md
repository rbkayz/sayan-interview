# 16 Jul - Interview with Sayan Kar

Hi Sayan,

There are three tasks I need you to accomplish. You can take upto 2 hrs for this, and revert when ready with whatever you have built.

The objective is to listen to an on-chain transaction event, and create a HTML using the txn params.

---

### 1 - Listen to on-chain events for any transactions done by a wallet address

* You can use any third party node service for this
* Build this on the Rinkeby Testnet of Ethereum
* I will provide the wallet address to you as an input variable

### 2 - Prepare two HTML templates (like emails) to inform a user about sent / received transactions

* One HTML is to inform a user of a received transaction
* One HTML is to inform the user of a sent transaction
* Make sure that all relevant information is included in the template (like gas fees, txn amount, block number, txn hash, etc.)
* And make it look nice please!

### 3 - Parse data from the transaction into the template

You may use any templating engine for this (like Handlebars js)

---

### Test condition - We will run a test transaction on the Rinkeby network using two wallet addresses. We should be able to generate two HTML files from that (one sent, and one received)
